# AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)

## Introduction
AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a web service that helps securely control access to AWS resources. It allows you to manage users, groups, roles, and permissions effectively.

---

## ðŸ”¹ **Key Features of IAM**
1. **Authentication & Authorization:**
   - Determines who is allowed inside the AWS account (authentication).
   - Defines what actions and resources are accessible (authorization).
2. **Granular Access Control:**
   - Users/services only get the permissions they need.
3. **Global Service:**
   - IAM is not region-specific and applies across all AWS regions.
4. **Integrated with AWS Services:**
   - IAM works seamlessly with most AWS services.
5. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**
   - Enhances security by requiring a second authentication factor.
6. **Identity Federation:**
   - Users from corporate directories or third-party identity providers can access AWS without creating separate IAM users.

## ðŸ”¹ **IAM Components**
### ðŸ“Œ **IAM User**
- Represents a person or service interacting with AWS.
- Each user has a unique set of credentials.
- IAM users can have:
  - AWS Management Console access (via username & password)
  - Programmatic access (via AWS CLI & API using access keys)

### ðŸ“Œ **IAM Groups**
- A collection of IAM users with similar permissions.
- Best practice to assign permissions via groups.
- Examples of IAM groups:
  - Developers
  - Security Analysts
  - Administrators

### ðŸ“Œ **IAM Roles**
- IAM roles provide temporary permissions to AWS services or users.
- Roles are assumed by entities, providing a secure way to grant access without long-term credentials.

### ðŸ“Œ **IAM Policies**
- Define permissions for users, groups, and roles.
- Written in JSON format.

**Example IAM Policy:**
```json
{
   "Version": "2012-10-17",    
   "Statement": [{         
        "Effect": "Allow",        
        "Action": "*",        
        "Resource": "*"     
   }]
}
```
This policy grants full access to all AWS services.

## ðŸ”¹ **Best Practices for IAM**
### ðŸ”’ **Lock Down the Root User**
- The root user has unlimited access.
- **Best practices:**
  - Do not share root credentials.
  - Delete root user access keys.
  - Enable MFA for the root account.

### ðŸ”’ **Follow the Principle of Least Privilege**
- Grant only the permissions necessary for a specific task.

### ðŸ”’ **Use IAM Roles Instead of Users Where Possible**
- Roles use temporary credentials that automatically rotate.

### ðŸ”’ **Use Identity Provider (IdP) for Authentication**
- Allows employees to use existing credentials for AWS access.

### ðŸ”’ **Use AWS IAM Identity Center (SSO)**
- Simplifies user authentication across multiple AWS accounts.
